        <h2>Section 1 &lt;HTML&gt;</h2>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and 
          structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's 
          appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
          "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between 
          websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to 
          pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>

        <p>An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name 
          surrounded by "&lt;" and "&gt;". The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written
          in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the  &lt;Title&gt; tag can be written 
          as &lt;Title&gt;, &lt;TITLE&gt;, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to
            write tags in lowercase.</p>

        <h2>Section 2 {CSS}</h2>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written 
          in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be 
          rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
          CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C 
          specifications. Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, 
          which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. 
          However, CSS4 has never become an official version.</p>

        <p>From CSS3, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules 
          started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately 
          per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest 
          stable state of the CSS specification</p>

        <h2>Section 3 .js</h2>
        <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class 
          functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments 
          also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
          single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional 
          programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.
          This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages 
          or other host environments. For information about APIs that are specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and 
          DOM.</p>

        <p>The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript 
          Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to 
          document it. This means that cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been 
          implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features. 
          Most of the time, this happens between the stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially 
          published.
          Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or 
          registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have
           very different syntax, semantics, and use.</p>

        <h2>Section 4 React.js</h2>
        <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building 
          user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of 
          individual developers and companies.React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, 
          or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with state 
          management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of 
          additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.</p>
